 - Decoupling woes -
I'm realizing that it's not the commands I should be sending, but the sound state that they send.
This is best exemplefied by how the mixer needs to call "jump" on the sequence, which makes absolutely no sense.
My proposal is to move the notion of commands entirely into the ui.

 - Instruments -
Make an instrument table and an instrument column.

 - PCM sample management -
Right now there's only one instrument, ideally I'd load them from a file.

 - resampling -
Linear is a good compromise, though something that lets me do filters would be awesome.
