* TODO basic program
** TODO commands
I want to make some simple set of commands, maybe replicate the protracker set
of commands. Maybe an interchangeable command format, even? Either way, I just
need a prototype for it and it's good not to get hung up.

** TODO editor
*** TODO draw the pattern
*** TODO keyboard
*** TODO mouse
*** TODO sample management

** TODO playback
*** TODO resampling
Not sure whether I want to limit sample rates/sizes and use something like a
blip buffer, or maybe linear interp?

Ideally I'd like to just have settings to emulate each given retro resampler here:
 - NONE
 - Blip Buffer
 - Linear
 - 4-tap gaussian (snes)
 - proper

An issue with the snes thing is that it should then have filter parameters. Best
to defer that imo.
*** TODO envelopes 
ADSR? Set of points? Polynomial? There's options here. Protracker is famous and
doesn't even have 'em, so I'll have to think about what I really want here.
